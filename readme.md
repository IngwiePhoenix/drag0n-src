# The drag0n source tree

This is a very large package, consisting of many different libraries which were litterally copied into the tree. No changes done to anything.

This is a development repository. It serves as a help to demonstrate how drag0n looks once disassembled. Feel free to look around and use this for whatever.

Check the real drag0n repository for more information.
